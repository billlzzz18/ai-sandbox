## Report Structure
1.  **Introduction:** Start with a clear introduction that states the purpose of the report.
2.  **Body:** Present the main findings and data in a logical order. Use headings and subheadings to organize the content.
3.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key points and provide a concluding statement.

## Data Sourcing
- When external information is needed, use the `search` tool.
- All sources must be cited appropriately at the end of the report.

## File Operations
- Use `read_file` to access local data.
- Use `write_file` to save the final report. The filename should be descriptive.
